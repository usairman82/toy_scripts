This is a placeholder for the screenshot.png file.

To generate the actual screenshot:
1. Open generate_screenshot.html in your browser
2. Click the "Generate Screenshot" button
3. Save the downloaded image as screenshot.png in the root directory

Alternatively, you can run:
npm run generate-screenshot

Note: The actual screenshot.png file should be a PNG image, not a text file.
This text file is just a placeholder to remind you to generate the real screenshot.
