# toy_scripts
A bunch of random scripts I've written for various purposes.

The scripts here-in come with no warranty express or implied, may be handwritten,
or may have had help from an LLM.

These scripts are either experiments, or little tools I've thrown together for
my own purposes.  Each will have a basic description of what it is for.


Script    : page_meta_data
Langauge  : Python
Automation: None yet.

A really simply API which tracks page visits in a dynamoDB in AWS.
I used this for very basic traffic metrics to a site I built.  It
has no concept of unique visits,etc.  But all that could be added
easily enough.
